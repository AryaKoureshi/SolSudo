Sudoku solver (SolSudo)

## Abstract
SolSudo is a sudoku solver that works with deep learning. SolSudo can solves sudokus by using images and it has an intelligence method. According to this method, the model predicts the blank digits, and when each level is completed, blanks are filled one after another. Each time a blank is filled, new sudoku will be fed to the solver to detect the next digit. Again and again, until there isn't a blank left. One of the features of this project is detecting sudoku from an image and filling in the blanks that require tesseract-ocr, however, which may cause problems. Therefore, I devised a method as in sudoku numbers are entered one by one, and 0 is used for blanks.
